<p>We have implemented a spam detector program in Python which classifies given emails as spam or ham based on applying Naive Bayes' theorem.</p>

<p>This program includes 3 executable files, 3 text files as well as 2 directories as follows:</p>
<p>Executable Files:</p>
<p>  1) spam_detector.py: Includes all functions required for classification operations.</p>
<p>  2) train.py: Uses the functions defined in the spam_detector.py file and generates the model.txt file after execution.</p>
<p>  3) test.py: Uses the functions defined in the spam_detector.py file and, after execution, generates the result.txt as well as evaluation.txt files.</p>
<hr>
<p>Output Files:</p>
<p>  4) model.txt: Contains information about the vocabularies of the train set, such as the frequency and conditional probability of each word in Spam and Ham classes.</p>
<p>  5) result.txt: Contains information about the classified emails of the test set.</p>
<p>  6) evaluation.txt: Contains evaluation results table as well as Confusion Matrix of Spam and Ham classes.
  This file was produced after executing the test.py file and was formed based on the results obtained from the result.txt file.</p>
<hr>
<p>Source Directories:</p>
<p>  7) train directory: Includes all emails for the training phase of the program.</p>
<p>  8) test directory: Includes all emails for the testing phase of the program.</p>

<h3 id="execution-instruction"><a class="anchor" name="execution-instruction" href="#execution-instruction"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Execution Instruction</h3>
<p>The order of execution of program files is as follows:</p>
<p>1) spam_detector.py</p>
<p>First, the spam_detector.py file must be executed to define all the functions and variables required for classification operations.</p>
<p>2) train.py</p>
<p>Then, the train.py file must be executed, which leads to the production of the model.txt file. 
At the beginning of this file, the spam_detector has been imported so that the functions defined in it can be used.</p>
<p>3) test.py</p>
<p>Finally, the test.py file must be executed to create the result.txt and evaluation.txt files.
Just like the train.py file, at the beginning of this file, the spam_detector has been imported so that the functions defined in it can be used.</p>
